        <p>
          Spotify announced that the Car Thing device would be permanently
          disabled on December 9th, 2024, effectively turning thousands of
          devices into e-waste. This announcement caught the attention of
          Nathan Emerick, who saw an opportunity to give these devices a
          second life.

        <p>
          Nathan joined the ThingLabs community and began hacking the Car
          Thing device. The project was initially called "TODOThing" as a
          placeholder while exploring what could be done with the hardware.
          Early experiments focused on understanding the device's
          capabilities and limitations.

        <p>
          As the project evolved, it became clear that the device had
          potential as a desktop companion. The name was changed from
          TODOThing to DeskThing, reflecting its new purpose as a
          productivity tool for desks. The first working prototype was
          developed, capable of displaying basic information.

          Word began to spread about the project, attracting interest from
          Car Thing owners looking for alternatives to Spotify's shutdown.
          The ThingLabs Discord server saw an influx of new members, and
          early adopters began testing the software and providing valuable
          feedback.

              These new devices will be purpose-built for the DeskThing

            formed around saving devices from obsolescence is now building
            something entirely newâ€”a testament to what can be accomplished when
            technology is approached with creativity, sustainability, and
            collaboration.
