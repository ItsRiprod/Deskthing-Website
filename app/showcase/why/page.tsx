            Modern smartphones have a relatively short shelf life, with most
            becoming obsolete within a few years. DeskThing gives new life to
            these devices that would otherwise end up as electronic waste,
            extending their useful lifespan and reducing environmental impact.
            As Christians are called to be good stewards of what we're given,
            DeskThing helps you recycle and add use to what you already own
            rather than contributing to more e-waste.

            For many users, especially in creative fields, managing multiple
            applications on a single screen can be overwhelming and inefficient.
            DeskThing transforms your desk with a customizable heads-up display
            that offloads non-essential applications to a secondary device,
            maintaining a clean desktop experience. From monitoring system
            resources to tracking stocks, weather, and sports scores, DeskThing
            complements your primary workstation without consuming valuable
            screen space.

          <p>
            DeskThing is designed to be lightweight, using minimal system
            resources on both the server and client sides. The core engine
            manages system resources efficiently, handles app communication
            seamlessly, and provides the foundation for all functionality while
            using less than 100MB of RAM and minimal CPU when idle. This ensures
            smooth performance even on older hardware, making it accessible to a
            wide range of devices that might otherwise be considered obsolete.
